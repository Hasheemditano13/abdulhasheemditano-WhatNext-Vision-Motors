## üìò Overview

**WhatNext Vision Motors** is a Salesforce-based application designed to streamline vehicle management for automotive businesses.  
The system manages vehicles, dealers, customers, test drives, and service requests efficiently, leveraging **Salesforce Lightning**, **Apex triggers**, **batch jobs**, and **automation flows**.

This project demonstrates Salesforce development capabilities through **custom objects**, **automations**, and **scheduled batch processes** for data handling and business process optimization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### 1. **Custom Objects**
The system includes several custom objects for managing business entities:
- **Vehicle__c** ‚Äì Stores vehicle details such as model, type, and stock quantity.
- **Vehicle_Dealer__c** ‚Äì Contains dealership information.
- **Vehicle_Order__c** ‚Äì Manages customer vehicle purchase records.
- **Vehicle_Customer__c** ‚Äì Stores customer details.
- **Vehicle_Test_Drive__c** ‚Äì Tracks customer test drive activities.
- **Vehicle_Service_Request__c** ‚Äì Records maintenance or service requests.

### 2. **Lightning App Creation**
A dedicated **Lightning App** was created to provide an integrated interface for managing vehicles, orders, and services.  
Each custom object is accessible through the app‚Äôs navigation for seamless interaction.

### 3. **Automation Flows**
Salesforce Flows were implemented to enhance user experience and automate manual tasks:
- **Auto Assign Dealer** ‚Äì Automatically assigns the appropriate dealer to a vehicle or order.
- **Test Drive Reminder** ‚Äì Sends reminders or notifications for upcoming test drives.

### 4. **Apex Classes and Triggers**
Custom Apex code was written to handle specific logic and background processes.

#### üîπ Apex Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `VehicleOrderTriggerHandler` | Contains reusable methods for handling vehicle order trigger logic. |
| `VehicleOrderTrigger` | Trigger that invokes the handler when records in `Vehicle_Order__c` are created or updated. |
| `VehicleOrderBatch` | Batch Apex job that processes large volumes of vehicle order data efficiently. |
| `VehicleOrderBatchScheduler` | Schedules batch jobs at defined intervals to automate data updates. |

### 5. **Batch and Trigger Jobs**
These Apex jobs ensure that processes such as stock updates, dealer assignment, and service reminders run automatically without manual intervention.

## üß† Business Logic Example

**Scenario:**  
When a vehicle order is created, the system checks the stock quantity.  
- If the **stock quantity is 0**, appropriate handling is triggered to prevent over-ordering or to initiate restocking workflows.  
- Batch jobs can also handle periodic checks and updates to ensure stock accuracy.
